This is a working example of the "good workflow" directory template.

You can render this example project...

	P-Project\3D\scenes\SEQ\010\SEQ_010_v001.blend

...in Better Brenda, using the "Upload .blend file with "good workflow" directory structure plus external artwork files" option.

To use this directory template in your own work, do the following:

	* Copy the "P-Project" directory to a non-repository location on your computer.
	* Do a search through the directory and remove every instance of the following things:
		- The file ".gitkeep"
		- The directory "SEQ"
	* Delete this readme.txt file!
